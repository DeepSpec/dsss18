      (* ... huh? Backup can get ahead?!

         Similar to our first attempt in Fresh, we are stuck again!
         This time the problem is that we didn't relate the local
         state of the nodes to the state of the network.  Again,
         the solution is to prove something stronger.

Abort.



(* This is what we want to prove, but it's not inductive!

      forall w,
        reachable' shuffle_step w ->
        backup_le_primary w

   What we do know is that the Backup's state plus the number of
   _pending_ Inc messages in the network is equal to the Primary's
   state.

   For extra practice, below try deleting the proofs reproving some of
   the list-y lemmas that end up being pretty common when reasoning
   about networks. *)
